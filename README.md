# 🚀 Drain Sewage – AI-Powered Robotic Drainage Cleaner

## 📌 Problem Statement
Manual sewage cleaning is hazardous and still practiced in some regions despite being banned. Human workers are exposed to toxic environments, infections, and life-threatening conditions while clearing blocked drainage systems.

## 🎯 Objective
To design and develop an **AI-powered robotic system** that can detect, monitor, and clean blockages in drainage pipes without human intervention.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Sensors & Cameras**: Detect blockages and provide live feed.
- **AI-Based Fuzzy Controller**: Keeps robot stable inside drains.
- **Robotic Arms**: Collects waste and loads it into the container.
- **Movable Belt System**: Transfers collected waste outside the drain.
- **Autonomous/Manual Modes**: Operable via controller or PC.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Hardware: Sensors, Motors, Battery, Camera, Robot Frame  
- Software: Python, Arduino, AI Controllers  
- Control: PC/Remote-based monitoring system  

## 🌍 Future Scope
- Deployable for **municipal sanitation & smart city infrastructure**  
- Used in **industrial wastewater management**  
- Multi-robot coordination for larger drainage systems  
- IoT-based monitoring dashboards  

## 🧠 Workflow (Robotic Cleaning Pipeline)

Start → Sensors detect blockage → Robot enters drain → Camera streams live feed
   → AI Controller aligns robot → Robotic arms collect waste
   → Movable belt transfers waste outside → Drain is cleared → End
