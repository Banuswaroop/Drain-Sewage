# Problem Statement
Sewage cleaning remains a challenge in urban and rural areas. Manual cleaning leads to serious health hazards and is socially unacceptable. Despite being banned, human workers are often forced into sewage pipes for cleaning, exposing them to toxic gases, infections, and unsafe conditions.

This project proposes a robotic system that automates sewage cleaning, using sensors, cameras, and robotic arms to detect and remove blockages inside drainage pipes.
