# Methodology

1. Sensors are placed in drainage pipes to detect blockages.
2. Once blockage is detected, the robot is deployed inside.
3. The camera provides live feedback for navigation and monitoring.
4. AI fuzzy controller ensures the robot remains stable in the middle of the drain.
5. Robotic arms collect and place the waste into a container.
6. Movable belt system disposes of collected waste outside the drain.
7. Robot resets and continues inspection.

This reduces overflow issues and prevents blockages in sewage systems.
